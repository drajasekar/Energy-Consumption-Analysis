# Energy-Consumption-Analysis

Project Overview
The Ontario BPS Energy and GHG Analysis project aims to analyze energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions of the Broader Public Sector (BPS) organizations in Ontario. The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset spanning from 2012 to 2021,
containing information about various BPS organizations, including public hospitals and school boards. The primary goal is to identify trends, assess conservation effectiveness, and pinpoint areas for improvement, ultimately informing 
data-driven strategies for achieving climate change mitigation goals within the BPS.

Data Understanding

Dataset Information
The dataset contains information about BPS organizations, including the following key attributes:

Sector: Represents the sector of the organization (e.g., Public Hospital, School Board).
SubSector: Provides further classification within the sector.
Organization: Name of the BPS organization.
Operation: Specific operation or facility within the organization.
Address, City, Postal Code: Location details of the organization.
Energy Usage: Information about electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, propane, coal, wood, district heating, and district cooling consumption.
GHG Emissions: Greenhouse gas emissions in kilograms.

Data Preparation and Cleansing
To ensure the data is suitable for analysis, follow these steps:

Handling Missing Values: Identify and handle missing values in the dataset.
Standardizing Units: Ensure consistency in units for energy usage and GHG emissions.
Deriving Relevant Features: Create new features that may enhance analysis.
Segmentation: Segment the data by relevant factors like sector, organization type, and facility size.
